mybuffalo
=========
this is a json rpc framework , imitate buffalo, but in json

the full framework include only two file :

mybuffalo.js and ApplicationServlet.java 

Gson is required.

front-end js side serialization and deserialization using native JSON.parse and JSON.stringify 
back-end java side serialization and deserialization using Gsong , I guess maybe we need to implemenet
our own serializer and deserializer someday in the future depends on our require.


TODO :

 implementation of back-end by node.js
